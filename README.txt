This project was created for a software engineering introductory course. I worked on this project with 4 classmates. 

Below is the list of the tasks I completed:

- Login activity layout and design 

- Manage category activity layout and design 

- Item controller
	- Add item to database 
	- Delete item from database 
	- Edit item in database

- View item activity
	- Displays a list of items that the lessor has posted 
	- Add item pop-up 
- Created Request Controller 

- View request activity 
	- Display an itemâ€™s list of request to the lessor 

- Modified item class, so items are properly saved with a lessor 

- Created layout_request_list_view, so a request has different icons than a regular entity
